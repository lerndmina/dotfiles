 
# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a free, portable, lightweight symlink farm manager. This allows the dotfiles to be organized in a clean way, while also being easily stowable to the home directory.

## Getting Started

### Installing


```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerndmina/dotfiles/master/install.sh
```
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```
```bash
./install.sh
```
